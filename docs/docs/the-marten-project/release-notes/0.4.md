_Under development._

## Requirements and compatibility

Crystal 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9.

## New features

### URL field for models and schemas

It is now possible to define `url` fields in [models](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields#url) and [schemas](../../schemas/reference/fields#url). These allow you to easily persist valid URLs in your models but also to expect valid URL values in data validated through the use of schemas.

For example:

```crystal
class User < Marten::Model
  field :id, :big_int, primary_key: true, auto: true
  field :website_url, :url, blank: true, null: true
end
```

### Minor features

#### Models and databases

* Support for removing records from many-to-many fields was added and many-to-many field query sets now provide a `#remove` helper method allowing to easily remove specific records from a specific relation. You can learn more about this capability in [Many-to-many relationships](../../models-and-databases/relationships#many-to-many-relationships).

#### Handlers and HTTP

* It is now optional to define a name for included route maps (but defining a name for individual routes that are associated with [handlers](../../handlers-and-http/introduction) is still mandatory). You can read more about this in [Defining included routes](../../handlers-and-http/routing#defining-included-routes).

#### Templates

* A [`with`](../../templates/reference/tags#with) template tag was introduced in order to make it easy to assign one or more variables inside a template block.
* The ability to configure how undefined/unknown variables are treated was added to the framework: by default, such variables are treated as `nil` values (so nothing is displayed for such variables, and they are evaluated as falsey in if conditions). This behavior can be configured via the [`templates.strict_variables`](../../development/reference/settings#strict_variables) setting, and you can learn more about it in [Strict variables](../../templates/introduction#strict-variables).

#### Development

* The [`new`](../../development/reference/management-commands#new) management command now accepts an optional `--database` option that can be used to preconfigure the application database (eg. `--database=postgresql`).
* A [`clearsessions`](../../development/reference/management-commands#clearsessions) management command was introduced in order to ease the process of clearing expired session entries.

## Backward incompatible changes

### Handlers and HTTP

* Custom [session stores](../../handlers-and-http/sessions#session-stores) must now implement a [`#clear_expired_entries`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/HTTP/Session/Store/Base.html#clear_expired_entries%3ANil-instance-method) method (allowing to clear expired session entries if this is applicable for the considered store).

### Templates

* The [`default`](../../templates/reference/filters.md#default) template filter will now return the specified default value if the incoming value is falsy or empty.
