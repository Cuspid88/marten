_Under development._

## Requirements and compatibility

Crystal 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8.

## New features

### URL field for models and schemas

It is now possible to define `url` fields in [models](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields#url) and [schemas](../../schemas/reference/fields#url). These allow you to easily persist valid URLs in your models but also to expect valid URL values in data validated through the use of schemas.

For example:

```crystal
class User < Marten::Model
  field :id, :big_int, primary_key: true, auto: true
  field :website_url, :url, blank: true, null: true
end
```

### Minor features

#### Templates

* A [`with`](../../templates/reference/tags#with) template tag was introduced in order to make it easy to assign one or more variables inside a template block.
* The ability to configure how undefined/unknown variables are treated was added to the framework: by default, such variables are treated as `nil` values (so nothing is displayed for such variables, and they are evaluated as falsey in if conditions). This behavior can be configured via the [`templates.strict_variables`](../../development/reference/settings#strict_variables) setting, and you can learn more about it in [Strict variables](../../templates/introduction#strict-variables).


#### Development

* The [`new`](../../development/reference/management-commands#new) management command now accepts an optional `--database` option that can be used to preconfigure the application database (eg. `--database=postgresql`).
* A [`clearsessions`](../../development/reference/management-commands#clearsessions) management command was introduced in order to ease the process of clearing expired session entries.

## Backward incompatible changes

### Handlers and HTTP

* Custom [session stores](../../handlers-and-http/sessions#session-stores) must now implement a [`#clear_expired_entries`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/HTTP/Session/Store/Base.html#clear_expired_entries%3ANil-instance-method) method (allowing to clear expired session entries if this is applicable for the considered store).
