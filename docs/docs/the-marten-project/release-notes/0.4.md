_Under development._

## Requirements and compatibility

Crystal 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8.

## New features

### Minor features

#### Templates

* A [`with`](../../templates/reference/tags#with) template tag was introduced in order to make it easy to assign one or more variables inside a template block.

#### Development

* The [`new`](../../development/reference/management-commands#new) management command now accepts an optional `--database` option that can be used to preconfigure the application database (eg. `--database=postgresql`).
* A [`clearsessions`](../../development/reference/management-commands#clearsessions) management command was introduced in order to ease the process of clearing expired session entries.

## Backward incompatible changes

### Handlers and HTTP

* Custom [session stores](../../handlers-and-http/sessions#session-stores) must now implement a [`#clear_expired_entries`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/HTTP/Session/Store/Base.html#clear_expired_entries%3ANil-instance-method) method (allowing to clear expired session entries if this is applicable for the considered store).
