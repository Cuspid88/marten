_Under development._

## Requirements and compatibility

Crystal 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6.

## New features

### Raw SQL capabilities

Query sets now provide the ability to perform raw queries that are mapped to actual model instances. This is interesting if the capabilities provided by query sets are not sufficient for the task at hand and you need to write custom SQL queries.

For example:

```crystal
Article.raw("SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title = ?", "Hello World!").each do |article|
  # Do something with `article` record
end
```

Please refer to [Raw SQL](../../models-and-databases/raw-sql) to learn more about this capability.

## Transaction callbacks

Models now support the definition of transaction callbacks by using the [`#after_commit`](../../models-and-databases/callbacks#aftercommit) and [`#after_rollback`](../../models-and-databases/callbacks#afterrollback) macros.

For example:

```crystal
class User < Marten::Model
  field :id, :big_int, primary_key: true, auto: true
  field :username, :string, max_size: 64, unique: true

  after_commit :do_something, on: :update

  private def do_something
    # Do something!
  end
end
```

Please refer to [Callbacks](../../models-and-databases/callbacks) to learn more about this capability.

### Minor features

#### Models and databases

* Support for [DB connection pool parameters](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/database/connection_pool.html) was added. See the [database settings reference](../../development/reference/settings#database-settings) for more details about the supported parameters
