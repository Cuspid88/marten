## Requirements and compatibility

Crystal 1.6 and 1.7.

## New features

### Support for streaming responses

It is now possible to generate streaming responses from iterators of strings easily by leveraging the [`Marten::HTTP::Response::Streaming`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/HTTP/Response/Streaming.html) class or the [`#respond`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/Base.html#respond(streamed_content%3AIterator(String)%2Ccontent_type%3DHTTP%3A%3AResponse%3A%3ADEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE%2Cstatus%3D200)-instance-method) helper method. This can be beneficial if you intend to generate lengthy responses or responses that consume excessive memory (a classic example of this is the generation of large CSV files).

Please refer to [Streaming responses](../../handlers-and-http/introduction#streaming-responses) to learn more about this new capability.

### Minor features

#### Development

* [`Marten::HTTP::Errors::SuspiciousOperation`](pathname:///api/0.2/Marten/HTTP/Errors/SuspiciousOperation.html) exceptions are now showcased using the debug internal error page handler to make it easier to diagnose errors such as unexpected host errors (which result from a missing host value in the [`allowed_hosts`](../../development/reference/settings#allowedhosts) setting)

#### Models and databases

* New [`#get_or_create`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set#get_or_create) / [`#get_or_create!`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set#get_or_create-1) methods were added to query sets in order to allow easily retrieving a model record matching a given set of filters or creating a new one if no record is found
* [`string`](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields#string) fields now support a `min_size` option allowing to validate the minimum size of persisted string field values
* A new [`#includes?`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set#includes) method was added to query sets in order easily perform membership checks without loading the entire list of records targeted by a given query set
* Alternative [`#exists?`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set#exists) methods were added to query sets in order to allow specifying additional filters to use as part of existence checks
* Marten migrations are now optimized to prevent possible issues with circular dependencies within added or deleted tables

#### Templates

* A [`join`](../../templates/reference/filters#join) template filter was introduced to allow converting enumerable template values into a string separated by a separator value
* A [`split`](../../templates/reference/filters#split) template filter was introduced to allow converting a string into an array of elements

## Backward incompatible changes

### Handlers and HTTP

* [Custom route parameter](../../handlers-and-http/how-to/create-custom-route-parameters) must now implement a [`#regex`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Routing/Parameter/Base.html#regex%3ARegex-instance-method) method and can no longer rely on a `#regex` macro to generate such method
* The generic handlers that used to require the use of a `#model` class method now leverage a dedicated macro instead. This is to make handlers that inherit from generic handler classes more type-safe when it comes to manipulating model records
* The generic handlers that used to require the use of a `#schema` class method now leverage a dedicated macro instead. This is to make handlers that inherit from generic handler classes more type-safe when it comes to manipulating schema instances
