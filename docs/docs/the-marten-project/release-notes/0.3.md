## Requirements and compatibility

Crystal 1.6 and 1.7.

## New features

### Minor features

#### Models and databases

* New [`#get_or_create`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set#get_or_create) / [`#get_or_create!`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set#get_or_create-1) methods were added to query sets in order to allow easily retrieving a model record matching a given set of filters or creating a new one if no record is found
* [`string`](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields#string) fields now support a `min_size` option allowing to validate the minimum size of persisted string field values
* A new [`#includes?`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set#includes) method was added to query sets in order easily perform membership checks without loading the entire list of records targeted by a given query set
* Alternative [`#exists?`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set#exists) methods were added to query sets in order to allow specifying additional filters to use as part of existence checks

#### Templates

* A [`join`](../../templates/reference/filters#join) template filter was introduced to allow converting enumerable template values into a string separated by a separator value
* A [`split`](../../templates/reference/filters#split) template filter was introduced to allow converting a string into an array of elements

## Backward incompatible changes

### Handlers and HTTP

* [Custom route parameter](../../handlers-and-http/how-to/create-custom-route-parameters) must now implement a [`#regex`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Routing/Parameter/Base.html#regex%3ARegex-instance-method) method and can no longer rely on a `#regex` macro to generate such method
