_Under development._

## Requirements and compatibility

* **Crystal:** 1.9, 1.10, and 1.11.
* **Databases:**
  * MariaDB 10.4 and higher.
  * MySQL 8.0.11 and higher.
  * PostgreSQL 12 and higher.
  * SQLite 3.27.0 and higher.

## New features

### Minor features

#### Models and databases

* A new [`#pks`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#pks) method was introduced for query sets to make it easy to retrieve the primary key values of the model records targeted by a given current query set.
* A [`#count`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/DB/Model/Querying/ClassMethods.html#count(field%3AString|Symbol|Nil%3Dnil)-instance-method) method is now available on model classes and provides the same functionality as the [`#count`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#count) query set method.
* A new [`#bulk_create`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#bulk_create) method was introduced to make it easy to insert multiple model instances into the database in a single query (which can be useful when dealing with large amounts of data that need to be inserted into the database).
* A new [`#average`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#average) method was introduced to allow computing the average values of a specific model field at the database level for the records targeted by a specific query set.
* A new [`#sum`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#sum) method was introduced to allow computing the sum of the values of a specific model field at the database level for the records targeted by a specific query set.
* It is now possible to compute the minimum and maximum values of a specific field at the database level for the records targeted by a query set through the use of the [`#minimum`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#minimum) and [`#maximum`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#maximum) methods.
* The [`in`](../../models-and-databases/reference/query-set.md#in) query set predicate now supports filtering on arrays of model records directly.

#### Handlers and HTTP

* The [`#render`](../../handlers-and-http/introduction.md#render) helper method and the generic handlers that involve template renderings now automatically insert the request object in the template context.

#### Templates

* Enum values can now be used in templates. Please refer to [Using enums in contexts](../../templates/introduction.md#using-enums-in-contexts) to learn more about this capability.

#### Security

* It is now possible to configure that the [CSRF](../../security/csrf.md) token must be persisted in the session store. This can be achieved by setting the [`use_session`](../../development/reference/settings.md#use_session) setting to `true`.

## Backward incompatible changes

### Handlers and HTTP

* Handlers making use of the [`Marten::Handlers::Schema`](pathname:///api/0.4/Marten/Handlers/Schema.html) generic handler (or schemas inheriting from it, such as [`Marten::Handlers::RecordCreate`](pathname:///api/0.4/Marten/Handlers/RecordCreate.html) or [`Marten::Handlers::RecordUpdate`](pathname:///api/0.4/Marten/Handlers/RecordUpdate.html)) will now return a **422 Unprocessable Content** response instead of a **200 OK** response when processing an invalid schema. While this won't have any incidence on end users, this change may make some specs fail if you were testing the response code of handlers that process invalid schema data. The way to fix this will be to replace `200` by `422` in the impacted specs.
